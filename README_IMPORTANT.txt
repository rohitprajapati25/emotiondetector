HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT ON A NEW LAPTOP
==========================================

Follow these steps to ensure the project runs perfectly on your other laptop for the competition.

1. PREREQUISITES (Must be installed on the new laptop):
   - Python 3.10+ (Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
     *IMPORTANT*: Check the box "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   - Node.js (Download: https://nodejs.org/)

2. SETUP (Run only once):
   - Double-click the file: INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.bat
   - This will automatically install all the AI libraries, TensorFlow, and Dashboard components.

3. STARTING THE SYSTEM:
   - Connect your USB Webcam.
   - Double-click the file: web_starter.bat
   - This will open two windows (AI Brain and Dashboard).
   - Once they are ready, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

4. COMPETITION TIPS:
   - Use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for the best experience.
   - If the camera doesn't show up immediately, use the "Reset Cam" button on the dashboard.
   - Ensure the laptop is plugged into power (AI/TensorFlow uses a lot of battery).

Good luck in the competition!
